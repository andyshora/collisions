# ItFits! Game

Will the shape fit through the hole? Introducing ItFits! A collision based game for kids.

## Collision Detection

Do we actually need collision detection if we know in advance if the meshes overlap? If we draw the meshes based on a success or fail flag, then we know when exactly to stop the walls, and can avoid computation on every frame!

## Objects Required

- Canvas - for game rendering
- Controls - for power-ups and yep/nope buttons, opening menu
- HUD - for displaying current level
- Menu - for entering hack codes to open secret levels
